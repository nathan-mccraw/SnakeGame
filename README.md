### Summary
This project was the largest project I've completed to date.  I continued my knowledge built from my previous project, the calculator app, to implement user inputs to set variables in JavaScript.  In this project I was introduced to the canvas in HTML/JavaScript and used the setInterval function to make an interactive environment.  The drawn shapes introduced me to the cartesian coordinate system as it relates to programming in order to implement collision detection.
