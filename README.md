## Installation

To use the Snake Game application:

1.  Follow this [link](https://nathan-mccraw.github.io/SnakeGame/) to play the game on your browser.

2.  To play the game locally and to obtain the code base for the application, you can either download a zip file of the code and application or you can fork this repository to       make changes and maintain version control.  You can download the code in a zip file by clicking "code" -> download zip from this repository dashboard (see picture below),       extrtact the files from the zip file and skip to step 6.  If you wish to fork this repository then go to step 3.

3. If you wish, you can fork this repository, which makes a copy of this repository and stores it to your repository (Github account required).

4.  Clone your repository to your local machine using the command line: [Git Clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone). This allows you to make changes to the snakegame app,       maintain version control, and save those changes to your repository.  Cloning the app directly from this repository will not let you freely push changes to the app.

5.  Navigate to the root directory of the app.  i.e. If you navigated to C:\Users\{YOUR ACCOUNT NAME}\Documents when you ran 'git clone', then there will now be a directory at       C:\Users\{YOUR ACCOUNT NAME}\Documents\Snake Game.  All application files will now be in this folder.

6.  If you only wish to run the application, navigate to C:\Users\{YOUR ACCOUNT NAME}\Snake Game to find index.html. Open this html file with google Chrome to view the               application without viewing the code.

### Summary
This project was the largest project I've completed to date.  I continued my knowledge built from my previous project, the calculator app, to implement user inputs to set variables in JavaScript.  In this project I was introduced to the canvas in HTML/JavaScript and used the setInterval function to make an interactive environment.  The drawn shapes introduced me to the cartesian coordinate system as it relates to programming in order to implement collision detection.
